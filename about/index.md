Hey there! My name's Eddie Zhou, as you can probably tell, and I suck at web design. I spend my time watching anime. You can find my (embarrassingly) long list of completed shows on [myanimelist](http://www.myanimelist.net/animelist/RonaldoMoon).

Thanks for reading!

You can [contact me](mailto:me@eddiezhou.me) by e-mail, or find my github page in the Projects section of this website.
